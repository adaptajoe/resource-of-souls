He has a Balanced playstyle, and is one of few characters in the game who has a Reawakening. Be wary of Uryū's miniscular Defense, Speed and Power - It's best to avoid attacks and to pick at opponents from a range, making use of Uryū's various techniques to overpower your enemies.",

Ulquiorra is a Hybrid Range fighter combining Fast Melee attacks with devastating Ranged abilities. His Balanced playstyle and unique Vampiric mechanics allow him to not only shed his Reishi to ehance his attacks, but also allows him to regenerate his Reishi over time. With excellent Speed and Range, moderate Power, but lower Defense and Technique, Ulquiorra excels at swift, precise strikes while maintaining pressure through his energy-based attacks; additionally, Ulquiorra is one of few characters in the game with access to a Reawakening, further exceeding his already high limits through the power of Segunda Etapa.",

In this state, his already formidable powers are compressed into a sleeker form, though the darkness that roars within him grows alongside his strength. As a Hybrid Range fighter, Bankai Ichigo combines Fast Melee combat with devastating Ranged attacks, utilizing both Charge moves and his unique 'Getsuga Aura' Gauge. He is also one of the few characters in the game who has access to a Reawakening. His Rushdown playstyle becomes even more aggressive, with the ability to Revive from near-death situations, leading to his Reawakening into his Full Hollowfication, where Ichigo becomes practically unstoppable. With balanced stats favoring Technique, Ichigo can adapt to any situation while maintaining constant pressure on his opponents.",

Blind since birth, Tōsen's pursuit of justice is paradoxically driven by a desire for revenge, leading him down a path of betrayal. As a Short Range fighter, he combines Melee combat with unique Ranged abilities, utilizing Gimmick mechanics that reflect his unique sensory abilities - After Awakening, his Bankai, 'Suzumushi Tsuishiki: Enma Korogi', activats his core Gimmick mechanic, which transports both players to a new arena temporarily and restricts the opponents' field of vision. His Trickster playstyle allows him to disorient opponents while setting up devastating combinations. With high Technique, moderate Speed and Defense, but lower Power and Range, Tōsen excels at confusing opponents before striking with precise attacks.",

Her unwavering dedication to duty is matched only by her admiration for her former mentor, Yoruichi Shihōin. As a Short Range fighter, she excels in Melee combat with Kidō support, utilizing both Charge attacks and Gimmick mechanics - Specifically her Suzumebachi's special ability, 'Nigeki Kessatsu', which allows Soi-Fon to kill her opponent instantly if it hits twice. Her Rushdown playstyle is enhanced by unique Reloader and Instakill mechanics, making her especially deadly at both close and medium range. With maximum Speed, high Technique, decent Range, but low Power and Defense, Soi-Fon can quickly overwhelm opponents with rapid strikes and deadly precision.",

    "description": "Former Captain of Squad 5 who orchestrated a complex and devastating betrayal of Soul Society. His immense power is matched only by his ambition and masterful manipulation of others, all in pursuit of subjugating the Hogyoku, transcending the boundaries between Shinigami and Hollow in order to form the Oken, and thus, to claim his throne atop the heavens. As a Short Range fighter, Aizen simply awaits his enemies, combining precise Melee combat with almighty defensive abilities that can negate damage. Aizen's unique Gimmick mechanic, the 'Hogyoku Fusion Level' Gauge, which fuels his Ramper playstyle - This allows him to gradually increase in power throughout the battle, evolving into different forms that grow in power. Once Awakening to his Third Form, Aizen uses his Reviver perk that allows him to use his Reawakening and transcend the natural order of the world. With the highest stat total in the game, exceptional Power, Defense, and Technique, and decent Speed and Range, Aizen excels at methodically dismantling opponents through careful ability usage, strategic planning and constant evolution.",

The animations for these two states are different, and swaps from 'Such Fun (A)' to 'That's Not It (B)' on successive uses. During 'Such Fun (A)', Shinji will stride towards the opponent, spinning his Zanpakuto in his hand. When he is hit with an attack in this state, he counters with a powerful slash. If no attack lands in this state, Shinji is left exposed for a significant amount of time. Breakers also will negate the counter of 'Such Fun (A)'. In the 'That's Not It (B)' state, Shinji strides towards the opponent, spinning Sakanade by its' ring, and has the same counter properties of 'Such Fun (A)'; the difference being that 'That's Not It (B)' won't leave Shinji exposed, and will instead automatically teleport him behind the opponent as if 'Such Fun (A)' was successful.",

A twisted scientist obsessed with perfection who treats battle as an experiment, modifying his servants and opponents to be able to face any opponent while maintaining a facade of sophistication. As a Short Range fighter, he combines precise Melee combat with his unique and complex mechanics. After Awakening, Szayelaporro's Gambler playstyle comes into play as he makes full use of his 'Spiritual Pressure Understanding' Gauge, which is filled by advancing his 'Analysis Process' count through applying and retrieving 'Rokureichu' on his opponents. Each of the three stages of the 'Spiritual Pressure Understanding' Gauge supplies different buffs, with the random possibility to claim more Konpaku through his Kikon Moves, and even the possibility of activating his Reviver perk, rebirthing him with a small amount of Reishi and Konpaku. With exceptional Technique, moderate Speed and Range, but low Power and Defense, Szayelaporro excels at gradually dismantling opponents through careful analysis and tactical superiority.",

Despite his apparent laziness, he's one of Soul Society's most powerful and experienced Captains. As a Short Range fighter, he combines Melee combat with unique Ranged abilities through his dual-wielding style. His Gimmick mechanics revolve around his various 'Childrens Games' that are started by Awakening; after Awakening, one of three 'Childrens Games' will be chosen to play, being 'Draw', 'King of the Hill' and 'Tag'. Each of them have unique rules to remember, and gives Shunsui the possibility to fall into a devastating loss or unexpected victory through his Gambler playstyle; his Charge attacks reflect his unpredictable nature, allowing him to get an edge in these games, and to throw off his opponents. With high Defense, Technique, and balanced offensive stats, Shunsui excels at controlling the flow of battle through his various games, turning simple combat into deadly form of child's play.",

            "description": "Shunsui becomes more serious and begins to activate his Shikai's `Children's Games`. When Awakened, Shunsui activates his Gambler abilities and begins one of three Children's Games; the first game is `Tag`, or `Hot Potato`, where one player is set as `It`. Attacking a player who is not `It` will make them `It`. During this game, damage cannot be dealt. After a certain period of time, the player who is `It` takes all of the collected damage that would have been inflicted during the game. For instance, if `A` is `It`, `A` attacks `B`, then `B` attacks `A`, and the game ends, then `A` will take all of the collected damage. The second game is `King of the Hill`, or `Capture the Zone`, where a `Zone` appears on the stage. If no players are in the Zone, they both will take passive damage to their Reishi. If one player is inside the Zone, then the passive damage to them is negated. The last game is `Quickdraw`, or `Duel`, where a `Signal` is given after a random period of time. The player who lands a hit closest to the activation of the `Signal` wins, and is given a significant Power boost until the beginning of the next Children's Game. If a player attacks before the `Signal` is given, then their opponent gains this boost automatically. It is not known what happens on frame-perfect draws in regards to this game.",

After Awakening, his 'Ryūmon' Gauge builds up as he maintains offensive pressure, providing further buffs, while his Rushdown playstyle allows him to overwhelm opponents with relentless attacks. With high Power and Speed, but lower Range, Defense, and Technique, Ikkaku excels at aggressive combat that rewards luck, maintaining offensive momentum through careful stance management, and constant pressure.",

As a Short Range, Slow, Melee character, Nnoitra loves nothing more than tanking hits with his Hierro (Which works like a Stance; once used it cannot be used again until it is expired, and expires on hit or over time) and taking advantage of the new openings this durability grants him. By harnessing his Hierro, Nnoitra can obtain Super Armor for one hit, greatly reducing damage and negative knockback to allow him to use powerful Breaker moves, Charge attacks and combos. His mid-range game is limited, but can be a good Poking option.",

Starrk is a dangerous character that has two distinct changes between his Unawakened and Awakening forms; whilst Unawakened, Starrk is a Long Range fighter that specialises in Ranged attacks, consuming his Reiatsu in exchange for his attacks. By using `The Two of Us Become One`, Starrk can remove this detrimental trade-off to fire multiple powerful Ceros extremely quickly. The more Reiatsu that Starrk has, the stronger, longer-lasting, and numerous his attacks become. Once performing his Awakening, Starrk transitions into a Close Ranged fighter with Mid Range and Hybrid Range capabilities, expertly controlling distance with crushing Melee strikes and Ranged wolf attacks. These abilities now can cost Starrk Konpaku ontop of Reiatsu, making the risk - but also the reward - far higher and sweeter.",
