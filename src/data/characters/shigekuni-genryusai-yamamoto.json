    "description": "The founding Captain-Commander of the Gotei 13, wielding the most powerful fire-type Zanpakuto. His stern leadership and overwhelming power has drove off countless threats, and has maintained order in Soul Society for over a thousand years. As a Short Range fighter, he combines devastating Melee combat with powerful Zoner abilities through his mastery over Ryujinjakka's flames. His unique Hellfire State mechanics and Inferno Gauge allow him to gradually increase the power of his flames, while his Charge attacks can instantly turn the tide of battle. With maximum Power and Defense, decent Range, high Technique, but minimal Speed, Yamamoto dominates through sheer destructive force and tactical positioning, burning all who dare oppose him to ash.",
