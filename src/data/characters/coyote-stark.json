    "description": "The Primera Espada and the Aspect of Loneliness. Stark is a dangerous character that has two distinct changes between his Unawakened and Awakening forms; whilst Unawakened, Stark is a Long Range fighter that specialises in Ranged attacks, consuming his Reiatsu in exchange for his attacks. By using `The Two of Us Become One`, Stark can remove this detrimental trade-off to fire multiple powerful Ceros extremely quickly. The more Reiatsu that Stark has, the stronger, longer-lasting, and numerous his attacks become. Once performing his Awakening, Stark transitions into a Close Ranged fighter with Mid Range and Hybrid Range capabilities, expertly controlling distance with crushing Melee strikes and Ranged wolf attacks. These abilities now can cost Stark Konpaku ontop of Reiatsu, making the risk - but also the reward - far higher and sweeter.",
