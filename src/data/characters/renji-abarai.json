    "description": "Lieutenant of Squad 6 under Captain Kuchiki, Renji's fierce determination drives him to constantly improve. Childhood friends with Rukia Kuchiki, he strives to surpass his Captain while maintaining his street-smart attitude and loyalty to his friends. As a Hybrid Range fighter, he combines powerful Melee attacks with unique Ranged abilities, featuring a Giant Summon through his Awakening, that allows him to sweep massive areas of the battlefield using his Bankai, Hihio Zabimaru. His Balanced playstyle allows him to adapt to various situations while maintaining consistent pressure. With high Speed and Range, good Power and Defense, but lower Technique, Renji excels at overwhelming opponents with his small but consistent moveset and extending combos.",
