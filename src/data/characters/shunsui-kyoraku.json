    "description": "The laid-back Captain of Squad 8 and lifetime friend of Jushiro Ukitake, whose carefree demeanor belies his tactical genius and deadly fighting style. Despite his apparent laziness, he's one of Soul Society's most powerful and experienced Captains. As a Short Range fighter, he combines Melee combat with unique Ranged abilities through his dual-wielding style. His Gimmick mechanics revolve around his various 'Childrens Games' that are started by Awakening; after Awakening, one of three 'Childrens Games' will be chosen to play, being 'Draw', 'King of the Hill' and 'Tag'. Each of them have unique rules to remember, and gives Shunsui the possibility to fall into a devastating loss or unexpected victory through his Gambler playstyle; his Charge attacks reflect his unpredictable nature, allowing him to get an edge in these games, and to throw off his opponents. With high Defense, Technique, and balanced offensive stats, Shunsui excels at controlling the flow of battle through his various games, turning simple combat into deadly form of child's play.",
