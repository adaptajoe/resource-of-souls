With maximum Power and Defense, decent Speed, but minimal Range and Technique, Zaraki is an unstoppable force once he gets close to his opponents, or lands a hellish Charge attack.",

    "description": "Captain of Squad 2 and Commander of the Stealth Force, Soi-Fon is a master of assassination and hand-to-hand combat. Her unwavering dedication to duty is matched only by her admiration for her former mentor, Yoruichi Shihōin. As a Short Range fighter, she excels in Melee combat with Kidō support, utilizing both Charge attacks and Gimmick mechanics - Specifically her Suzumebachi's special ability, 'Nigeki Kessatsu', which allows Soi-Fon to kill her opponent instantly if it hits twice. Her Rushdown playstyle is enhanced by unique Reloader and Instakill mechanics, making her especially deadly at both close and medium range. With maximum Speed, high Technique, decent Range, but low Power and Defense, Soi-Fon can quickly overwhelm opponents with rapid strikes and deadly precision.",

Despite his apparent laziness, he's one of Soul Society's most powerful and experienced Captains. As a Short Range fighter, he combines Melee combat with unique Ranged abilities through his dual-wielding style. His Gimmick mechanics revolve around his various 'Childrens Games' that are started by Awakening; after Awakening, one of three 'Childrens Games' will be chosen to play, being 'Draw', 'King of the Hill' and 'Tag'. Each of them have unique rules to remember, and gives Shunsui the possibility to fall into a devastating loss or unexpected victory through his Gambler playstyle; his Charge attacks reflect his unpredictable nature, allowing him to get an edge in these games, and to throw off his opponents. With high Defense, Technique, and balanced offensive stats, Shunsui excels at controlling the flow of battle through his various games, turning simple combat into deadly form of child's play.",
