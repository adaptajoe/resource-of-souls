    "description": "The current Tres Espada and the Aspect of Sacrifice; Tier is a Rushdown Hybrid Range Melee character that utilises her unique Aura Gauge in order to boost her offensive capabilities; hitting enemies with attacks builds her Aura Gauge, and failing to land attacks after a short period of time decreases the Aura Gauge - Utilising her extreme combo potential and constantly beating her opponents down, Tier makes the most of her Gauge by never giving her opponent an inch. If the opponent gains distance, using Tier's Spiritual Pressure 1 Move, 'Ola Azul' will provide a good Poking option to keep her gauge up. After Awakening, Tier's range increases considerably, and further increases the buffs provided by her Aura Gauge.",
